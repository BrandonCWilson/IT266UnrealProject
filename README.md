Project 1 for IT266, Spring 2017

Blueprints were changed within the default "First-Person Shooter" template in UE4. The gun shoots a projectile, the projectile splits into 3 more projectiles on impact, which also split into more projectiles. This happens a few times, and stops at an explosive effect.
